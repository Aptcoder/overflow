### Algorithm Explanation

Using the big O notation, the time complexity for the compress function written is O(n) —— linear time complexity.

The function uses two pointers which iterate through the characters in the given string at the different paces.
In the worst case, the function iterates through all the characters in the string, hence if the number of characters are for example doubled, twice as many iterations would be required for the function to complete.

The described relationship between the number of characters in the string to be compressed and the number of iterations is linear hence the linear time complexity.
